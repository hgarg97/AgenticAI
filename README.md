# 🚀 Learning Agentic AI – Hands-on Projects

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my journey through **Agentic AI** and **Generative AI**.

This repo serves as a practical learning hub where I implement projects and concepts I learn, gaining deep insights into modern LLM frameworks, agents, tools, and orchestration strategies driving the next wave of AI applications.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- Fundamentals of Agentic AI and Agent Architecture
- LLM-based Planning, Tool Usage, and Memory
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Autonomous AI Agents (AutoGPT, BabyAGI, CrewAI)
- LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Assistants, and more
- Real-world project workflows involving multi-agent systems

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder in the root directory corresponds to a specific **topic**, **concept**, or **project** from the course.

````

Each folder includes:

- Code files (`.py`, `.ipynb`)
- Notes or markdown explanations where relevant
- Resources or links to external documentation

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hgarg97/AgenticAI.git
   cd AgenticAI
````

````

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**

   ```bash
   conda create -p venv python==3.13
   conda activate venv/
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   Each project folder may have its own `requirements.txt` as needed. Install the required libraries before running the code:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> Note: The `venv/` folder is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
