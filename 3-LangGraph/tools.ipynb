Musk deleted some of his most inflammatory X posts, including the one relating to Epstein and another agreeing with the suggestion that Trump should be impeached.

Musk wrote on Sunday, “A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.” [...] The Department of Government Efficiency is the effort to slash the size of the federal government that was led by Musk until late May. That was followed days later by a very public falling out between Musk and Trump, with the billionaire accusing the president of being linked to Jeffrey Epstein.
